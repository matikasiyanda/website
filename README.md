# PKGWâ€™s Website

This is the source code for [my personal website](https://newton.cx/~peter/).
The HTML is generated by [Gutenberg](https://www.getgutenberg.io/), a great
static site generator tool.

Feel free to crib from this! The theme is of my own design. To generate the
site, just run

```
gutenberg build
```

or

```
gutenberg serve
```

to serve it locally.
