I want to call out something neat I saw on
[astro-ph](http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/recent) the other day.
[Linda Watson](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lwatson/) and collaborators posted
a paper,
[Properties of Bulgeless Disk Galaxies II. Star Formation as a Function of Circular Velocity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1555),
with the following comment:

> 23 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ. For a brief

Indeed, if you follow the link, you can see a nice 5-minute video of Linda
explaining the gist of the work, a sort of video abstract.

I like to think that my reading comprehension skills are pretty OK but I often
scan abstracts on interesting-sounding but unfamiliar topics only to later
realize that I’ve absorbed absolutely _nothing_ from them. I think the video
alternative is great for this situation, for the same reason that we’ve got
lectures as well as textbooks: there’s something about watching a person talk
out an idea that’s evidently a lot easier for the brain to follow, even if
reading is more efficient.

It’s also nice to put a human face on the work. Even for those
[topics that I know more about](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0330), where the
written abstract doesn’t go in one ear (eye?) and out the other, I think it’d
be fun to see the author’s body language and maybe glean a bit about their
approach to the topic. Hopefully Linda’s paper will be the start of a trend!
