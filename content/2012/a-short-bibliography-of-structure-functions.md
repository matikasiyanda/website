“Structure functions” (SFs) are often used for the analysis of variability in
astronomy. Today I spent some time tracking down some of the original
references and I thought I’d record what I found for posterity.

It’s surprisingly difficult to find pedagogical references for SFs as used in
the astronomical context. Lindsey and Chie below refer to them as “Kolmogorov
structure functions,” and there’s
[a Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_structure_function)
on that topic, but it’s _far_ more abstract than what astronomers would want:
in fact, I’m pretty sure that it’s totally unrelated, but it’s so abstract
that I can’t actually tell. The basic references define SFs in terms of
“increments” on random processes but I can’t find a lot of explanatory
material in that direction either. For pedagogical background, Lindsey and
Chie below reference generic textbooks on random processes (e.g., “Theory of
Stationary Random Functions,” A. M. Yaglom, Prentice-Hall, 1962).

One of the original references, if not _the_ original reference, seems to be
[Kolmogorov (1941)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1941DoSSR..30..301K), in
“Doklady Akademiia Nauk SSSR” **30** 301, which is translated and available
online in
[1991 RSPSA 434 9](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991RSPSA.434....9K). (This
is the Kolmogorov turbulence paper.) Unsurprisingly it isn’t very helpful
pedagogically.

The next step along one particular intellectual path is the apparent
introduction of SFs into the engineering literature by
[Lindsey and Chie (1976)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976IEEEP..64.1652L)
[[DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1976.10408)], with an overview in
their Appendix I. A few years later
[Rutman (1978)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978IEEEP..66.1048R)
[[DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1978.11080)] also presented SFs in a
very similar context (in that paper’s Section VIII). I haven’t digested the
papers but Rutman is much more highly-cited than Lindsey and Chie.
[Prokhorov et al (1975)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975IEEEP..63..790P)
[[DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.9828)] appear to have introduced
SFs in the IEEE Proceedings first but don’t explain things as clearly.

It looks like SFs were then brought to astronomy by
[Rickett, Coles, & Bourgois (1984)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984A%26A...134..390R),
though a close second are
[Simonetti, Cordes, & Heeschen (1985)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...296...46S).
The latter reference Lindsey & Chie and Rutman and have an appendix that gives
a nice rundown of some of the basic useful properties of SFs in the same style
as those. Rickett et al have a less helpful explanation.

After writing the first version of this bibliography, I found
[Emmanoulopoulos et al (2010)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.404..931E),
which gives a nice and thorough astronomical SF bibliography and also
discusses caveats of SFs in astronomical usage. Another couple recent papers
going into SF properties in various specialized astronomical circumstances are
[Hughes, Aller, & Aller (1992)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJ...396..469H)
and
[de Vries et al (2005)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AJ....129..615D).
There are many more relevant recent papers out there than just these, though.
