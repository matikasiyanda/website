Another note to self.  

I looked into merging the SMA version of MIRIAD into mainline CVS. It’s a
little scary, but I at least got things to compile. My fixes
[here](https://gist.github.com/1436133). The merge itself is also involved
because SMA MIRIAD was branched off of an old version. I don’t know if this
will ever get merged since there is a lot of sketchy code in there.
