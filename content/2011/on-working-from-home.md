I’ll often leave the office planning to finish up a small bit of business at
home: read a paper, work on a manuscript, write a bit of code, or something
else along those lines. It almost never happens in practice. I don’t think I’m
the only one who has this experience — I know that my adviser has the best of
intentions, but whenever he tells me that he’ll take care of something “this
evening,” I can assume that it won’t get done. (He’s at least got a family to
go home to, while all I have is this tear-stained magazine clipping of Justin
Bieber.)

In my case, the Internet is the problem: when I’m physically at work, I do a
good job of not distracting myself every ten seconds with Twitter, blogs, and
the rest; but at home, I don’t. (Perhaps relatedly, the one kind of homework
that I do well is that _ur_-distraction, email.) I’ll sit down and be
_totally_ ready to do something useful but then some funny link will come up
and suddenly it’s midnight. I’ve found that I have enough discipline to _keep_
working once I get going, but unless _super_-hard deadlines are involved I
don’t have enough discipline to _start_ working in the first place.

I think that I’ll be more likely to start my homework if I believe that I’ll
finish it quickly — “OK, I’ll just get this over with, then I can go back to
YouTube.” So I’m going to try imposing a **half-hour homework rule**: if I
plan to do non-urgent homework, I’ll be satisfied with half an hour of effort.
During that time, I won’t let myself get distracted, but once it’s passed,
I’ve done my duty and can go back to cat videos if I want. If I get engrossed
and want to keep going, so be it, but I will refuse to feel bad for calling it
quits after thirty minutes.

I’m optimistic about this strategy. I think the name is catchy, too, and isn’t
that half the battle right there?
