Most scientific journals offer articles in HTML format, but the conversion is
usually pretty poor — see, to pick a typical example,
[Wilms et al. 2007](http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/663/2/L97/fulltext).
The HTML version is definitely readable, but has some rough edges, and doesn’t
really give you much of a reason to prefer it to
[the PDF version](http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/663/2/L97/pdf/1538-4357_663_2_L97.pdf)
(if your PDF reader is any good).

Sometime recently the publishers of Annual Reviews
[revamped their website](http://www.annualreviews.org/) and clearly put some
effort into doing a better job — for example,
[Morales & Wyithe 2010](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130936).
The design is more attractive. The figures and references float, so you can go
between them and the text more easily. Internal and external links are more
pervasive, and content is offered in multiple formats, including figures as
PowerPoint slides for the truly lazy talk-preparer. There are definitely
quibbles one could offer, but the overall experience is much nicer than
anything else that I’ve seen. A similar amount of effort has been put into the
overall website, linking together all of the journals. It’s really nice to
see.
