On Solaris:  *   **ps xa** becomes **ps -ef** *   **ps xauwww** becomes
**pargs** *   **strace** becomes **truss** *   **find \[args\]** becomes
**find . \[args\] -print**  On MacOS X:  *   **strace** becomes **dtrace** or
**ktrace** *   **ldd** becomes **otool -L**  To be updated, no doubt, as time
passes â€¦
