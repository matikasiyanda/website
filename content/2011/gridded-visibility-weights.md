No actual science content here — I just thought this looked cool:

Gridded visibility weights.

This maps out how much information one of the ATA antennas contributed to the
sampling of the sky during one of my observations. Each track comes from its
pairing with another antenna and moves elliptically as the Earth rotates. The
space that’s being mapped is the “visibility” plane, the 2D Fourier transform
of the sky.
