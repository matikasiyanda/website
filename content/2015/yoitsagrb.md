A little while ago, Harvard grad student Phil Cowperthwaite and I put together
a little experiment in hooking up astronomical data to cloud-based Web
services. Itâ€™s called [YOITSAGRB](http://pkgw.github.io/yoitsagrb/), and we
[described the experience](http://www.astrobetter.com/web-apps-in-the-cloud-
even-astronomers-can-write-them/) on AstroBetter. It helps to have some hand-
holding, but it can be amazingly straightforward to set up a web service these
days! Check out the [AstroBetter post](http://www.astrobetter.com/web-apps-in-
the-cloud-even-astronomers-can-write-them/) for more information.
[YOITSAGRB](http://pkgw.github.io/yoitsagrb/) is open source, of course, with
the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/pkgw/yoitsagrb) under the [MIT
License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
