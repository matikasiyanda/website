Made what I think are some good improvements to my data reduction process
today. I polished up one tool for looking for RFI and got a quick version of a
tool that allows manual baseline flagging based on the results of self-
calibration. After applying the RFI tool, my spectra results were still
largely very ratty, so I hope that the self-cal based one will get them
towards respectability. It’s a bit late here though so I’ll find out about
that tomorrow.
