Workwise, the only worthwhile thing I did today was to have a long
conversation about the digital end of the ATA interferometer. It definitely
cleared up a few issues for me, though a few more were raised — I need to
understand how the DDC component operates a bit better. I spent some time
trying to think about it in the afternoon but didn’t accomplish much.
Hopefully tomorrow will have yield more concrete progress.
