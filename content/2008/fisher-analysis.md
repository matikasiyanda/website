Haven’t gotten much done in the past few days with seeing the Red Sox play,
hosting another prospective grad student, and feeling a little sick. After
discussions with Eliot and Geoff, it looks like I need to investigate whether
thermal radio emission (AKA free-free AKA _der bremsstrahlung_) will make it
more difficult for us to detect the signal that we’re looking for.
Unfortunately, at the moment it looks like the answer is “yes”, although I
think I’ve figured out how to minimize its impact.  Anyway, quantifying this
actually involves doing some formal analysis, taking derivatives and things. A
Fisher matrix seems to be the tool that I want. It’d be kind of fun to do
something a little different like this for a bit, but there’s really no need
to spend much time on this if I can figure out what I need to figure out. So
I’ll probably do some quick and dirty numerical stuff and call it a day.
