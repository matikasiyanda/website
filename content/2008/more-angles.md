I continue to work on ATA-related things without actually trying to obtain new
ATA data. There are just too many elements of the system that are in flux
right now for it to be worthwhile to observe, in my opinion.

On Monday I gave a short demo of some work I did looking at the
reproducibility of fluxes that one can get with the ATA. With the right poking
and prodding I can get things consistent to the 5% level, which people seemed
fairly encouraged by. But those 5% variations are definitely not just due to
the inherent noise in our observations; we have some crazy systematics going
on. As always, I wish I could understand them better. I’m doing what I can.

I’m also spending some time working on a “cookbook” for ATA data reduction
that will hopefully be useful for people. The idea is to record the standard
way of processing such- and-such kinds of data. I think by now I’ve worked
with enough ATA data to have some useful contributions to the cookbook.

Unfortunately, my contributions depend on the special analysis programs I’ve
written, and they have an enormous learning curve. There’s no chance that a
non-computer-guru will want to, or easily be able to, learn how to use them,
and because of the number of support libraries my tools require, it takes a
fair amount of work to even get them to run at all. So over today and the next
few days, I’m basically performing the frustrating task of stripping out some
of my favorite features to make my tools 1) easy to run and 2) easy to
understand. If the cookbook actually gets used, it’ll be very much worthwhile,
but so far there’s been frustratingly little willingness among ATA users to
share any of their algorithms or techniques. I’m certainly guilty of that
myself a bit, but I feel like most people are a lot less willing to spend time
dicking around writing their own programs than I am.

Over the course of the next week, the cookbook will probably take most of my
time. I might make a computerized version of a useful little block diagram
that I drew of the ATA signal path. I also could look at tidying up a little
tool I wrote for checking the status of the ATA from Berkeley, but that ties
into some software tasks that could end up taking a fair amount of time to
take care of.
