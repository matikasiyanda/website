Well, I’ve been intending to update this for a little while, but haven’t
actually done so. But I keep on forgetting what I’ve done over the past week,
which could be helped … if I had some kind of _log_ … on the _web_ …

What I’d like to get done this week:

* Reduce data from my observations on Tuesday — give them a pass with Karto’s
  RFI scripts and see how that goes.
* Continue working on computing system temperatures — see if we can generate
  higher- quality images with data with TSyses embedded. 
* Continue working on aperture photometry — see if I can reduce the scatter of
  my results.
* Update my observing scripts to be a bit easier for the ATA operators to run. 
* Apply for observing time next week.
* Read “Radio Emission from Normal Galaxies” (Condon, 1992, ARAA **30** 575)
