See, this is what happens when the blogging momentum stops. Gotta claw your
way back into the swing of things.  Today was mostly a planning day. I took
care of a bunch of miscellaneous tasks: scheduling meetings, printing things
out, updating some code here and there, a homework problem, checking in on
some projects that I haven’t touched for a while.  I also met with Geoff to
talk some more about the next step with my ATA work. I think we have a good
vision of the direction we want to go,  and the specific next thing to work on
seems pretty clear: a published paper showing how well we can do broadband
spectra and applying them to a self-contained science problem. We need to
think about things a bit more, but we have an idea to look for spectral breaks
in the radio emission of star-forming galaxies, which could tell you about the
energetics of these galaxies’ electron. This is interesting because
understanding that is a piece of the puzzle of understanding star formation on
galactic scales, since the electrons’ emission is a widely-used tracer of star
formation activity.  To really get a good result on these star-forming
galaxies would require a long, thorough observing campaign. But we can start
by looking at just a few galaxies and proving that our technique works. This
is the sort of thing that sounds like a good ApJ Letter: “Here’s a technique
we developed, here are a few example results, feel free to overinterpret them
if you want to.” If we’re lucky, the results for the first few galaxies might
be interesting in and of themselves, but even if not, the important thing is
to lay the groundwork for future, broader work.
