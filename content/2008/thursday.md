Let’s see. Yesterday I made the changes to my observing scripts that I wanted
to do. I’m a little worried because they feel a bit fragile — one of the
changes is to run a bunch of observations in sequence, which involves trying
to make my script be able to skip up to the middle of a batch of observations
if it gets restarted. That’s the sort of logic that can easily go wrong, and
unfortunately it’s hard to test.

I spent a little bit of time looking at aperture photometry. After my initial
work, it provides results that seem about as good as the image-fitting I’ve
been doing before. But I think I’d like to see what performs better on
high-quality images before deciding whether to pursue the apphot more.
Unfortunately, most of my images have flagging issues at the level of accuracy
that I’d like to work at, so I feel like I need to figure out a way to fix my
flagging once and for all before I can decide what to do with the the apphot.
Unfortunately, I’ve work on fixing flagging once and for all several times
now, and it never seems to work.

I also started rereading the Condon paper a bit. It’s a long one, so I’ll
hopefully work on it piecemeal over the next few days.

I also put in my observing proposal. (Woo for taking care of the small things
first!)
