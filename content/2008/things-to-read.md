The start of the semester was pretty busy with non-science things (such as,
well, going on vacation), but now I’m back and at it.  Earlier this week I did
some background reading. Geoff had me go over a couple of papers relating to
compact symmetric objects (CSOs), an unusual kind of radio source that’s
bright but very young. Let’s see, we have ….  *   [The Statistics and Ages of

well-understood and that broadband spectra in the centimeter regime (e.g.,
what I’m trying to do with the ATA) could provide important observational
data.  The latter papers lay the theoretical groundwork for undestanding
synchrotron jet spectra, which is what the centimeter emission of these
sources likely represents.
