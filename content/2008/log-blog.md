Trying to keep the posting pace up. What did I do today?

- Followed an email thread with some in-depth analysis of the performance of
  the SETI beamformer, which isn’t strongly connected to my ATA science work,
  but I’d like to get as global a view of the components of the ATA as
  possible.

- Also joined in some discussion about how the ATA’s control software is
  managed. I wrote a quick monitor program that I’d like to integrate into the
  software package, and my question about how to add the program to the
  software suite got people talking about how things ought to be as opposed to
  how they currently are. I will probably look into this some more as I’m fond
  of this aspect of software design.
- Continued some analysis that I started yesterday with my old broadband
  spectra dataset. It’s been a long time that I looked at this stuff. I added
  bandpass calibration to the analysis pipeline, since some tests I did made
  it look like it improves one’s results pretty significantly. I also made
  some other changes based on a few other things I’ve learned in the past few
  weeks. I realized that the particular data set that I’m working with
  presents some extra problems since my best reference source set early into
  the night. I was hoping to calibrate a second source based on the first one
  and use it for the rest of the night, but the results I get from that are
  too far from ideal to trust at all. I think this is the time-smearing
  rearing its head, since the residuals I get from a straight point-source fit
  are pretty severe.

That last item is most directly related to what I should be working on, but
unfortunately I’m not sure what I should take a look at tomorrow. I guess, now
that I think my better calibrations are settled, I can check out how well my
fringe-rate compensator helps. Or I can spend some time on one of the many
miscellaneous tasks I’d like to take care of.
