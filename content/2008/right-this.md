I’ve actually been back at work for about a week now but haven’t gotten back
into the swing of keeping this up-to-date. But that will change!

The day is just starting, so I don’t have any progress to report right now,
but here are the things I’d like to get done this week:

* Prepare for observations of HAT-P-2 on Friday night. I’d like to be able to
  track target exposure times and check how stable my PSF is, in real time. I
  have a bit of software put together to get started on this, but need to do a
  lot more.
* For my reading seminar on planet formation, I need to think about the
  viscous disk physics of Lynden-Bell & Pringle some more, since they seem to
  gloss over some very important points in their paper.
* Read up on the radio spectra of star- forming galaxies to get an idea of
  what I could do with ATA observations of them.

Sounds like a plan.
