This weekend I cleaned up some of my Python code for processing MIRIAD data.
Garrett Keating has been doing some work on RFI flagging similar to mine, but
he’s been using C shell and was running into speed and language problems. I
wrote a small module that lets you get at the raw data as straightforwardly as
possible, and I’m hopeful that he’ll find it all useful. He’s not used to a
Python/Numpy environment, though, so I’m curious how easy it’ll be for him to
pick up. I hope that the barrier isn’t tall.

I also spent a tiny bit of time thinking about what I need to do to get my
next broadband spectra project rolling. I’ve been blocking on meeting with
Eliot and Geoff to talk over some ideas, but it’s easy to get distracted while
waiting for things like that to happen. Need to keep my eyes on the prize.
