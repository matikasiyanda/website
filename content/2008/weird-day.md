Felt kind of off, work-wise, today. Slept in, took forever to get out the door
and actually make it to work, didn’t really feel like I accomplished much once
I got there. I … wrote the beginnings of a checklist to follow for obtaining
my ATA data? That actually will be useful eventually, but not any time soon.
Eventually I gave up trying to do immediately useful stuff, so I spent a bunch
of time restructuring some code. I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t
basically a way to do work-related activities without actually having to focus
on what I’m trying to accomplish these days.  Hopefully tomorrow I’ll feel
more “on”.
