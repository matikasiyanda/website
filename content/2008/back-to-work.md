Actually getting some things done. The past couple of days were spent up at
Lick, trying to observe an exciting star that may host a planet. The first
night was Murphyâ€™s Law run wild: I had a whole raft of unusual problems to
work through, and I barely got any useful data. The second night was much
better and I hope that the data I got were pretty good.

Today, I read a paper for Planet Formation tomorrow and wrote up the skeleton
of my BBS reduction pipeline. I had gotten really wrapped up in flagging but
forgot that I could proof-of-concept the pipeline without doing any flagging
at all. It was good to get this stuff done, because now I can always process a
batch of data, see how it looks, go back and flag some more, see how it
improves, and continue iterating that way. Much better than just flagging away
until the data look as perfect as possible, even though the difference is
basically entirely psychological. Amusingly, what I was doing went _straight_
back to what I kept on saying in 120: get the end-to-end working first, _then_
worry about the details. I should listen to myself more often.
