Very little done today, since I was doing a few (important) errands. But I did
get the chance to download and fool around with some of the FX32 data that’ve
been coming in to the ATA lately. The data aren’t mine, but I wanted to
investigate what the prospects are for calibration and error-flagging. I only
just scratched the surface today, but it looks like there are a few things
that’ll be worth looking into.

Tomorrow is the first day of a two-day workshop on astronomy education. One of
the workshop organizers gave a really interesting colloquium today and I think
the workshop should be, as the say, fun and informative.
