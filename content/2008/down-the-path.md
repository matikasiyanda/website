Flagging continues. Today was divided between just doing it for the data that
I’ve had for a while, even though I’m not very comfortable with the results,
and continuing my ongoing struggle to understand the artifacts that the ATA
inserts into its data. I’m doing this with data from some test observations I
made a few nights ago. The data were intended to be very nice and well-
behaved, and in many ways they are, but the various infidelities that I see
are maddeningly inconsistent from dataset to dataset. At least, I can’t crack
what’s going on with them.
