On Sunday I received some terrible news: that Don Backer, a professor in the
UC Berkeley Astronomy Department, had collapsed outside his home and died,
probably due to a heart attack. Compared to many of the old hands in the
department, I only knew Don very briefly; but in the relatively short time
that I’ve been at Berkeley, he became someone that I really looked up to and
had tremendous respect for, both as a scientist and as a person. For someone
his age (which wasn’t young, but was definitely far younger than it should
have been) he was amazingly active on all fronts: pushing genuinely exciting
research, performing valuable service for the department and the radio
community, and being a great mentor to a younger generation of radio
astronomers, of which I’m fortunate to count myself as a member. I’ll miss him
a lot.

(The Nature blog published a short obituary for Don
[here](http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2010/07/don_backer_astronomer_and_disc_1.html).)
