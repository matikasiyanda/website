I was a little surprised to find out from [Casey
Law](http://twitter.com/caseyjlaw) that _Nature_ recently ran a news piece
about the astronomy [Decadal
Review](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810) process — and they
didn’t just report on it, they actually got a group of prominent astronomers
together for dinner to discuss their impressions of how well the review
process works and what its outcome might be this time around. Unfortunately,
the article’s behind a paywall, so you probably can’t read it, but [here’s a
link to it](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100217/full/463868a.html) if you
have a university Internet connection.  I’m not the most gung-ho SKA supporter
on the planet, but I was surprised to see how low it ranked in the Nature
group’s list of priorities. As far as I can tell it was _never_ mentioned
during the hour-long panel discussion ([paywalled transcript
link](http://go.nature.com/ITkwWr)) and the group ranked it last out of seven
projects that they’d recommend for funding. Ouch.  You can rationalize a bit
by saying that the SKA is more than a decade off, and the group even talked
about how major projects have recently taken two iterations of the Decadal
Review to get significant momentum behind them, while this is the first go-
round for the SKA. Still, maybe this is a sign that the SKA community needs to
get more aggressive about its PR. On the more personal front, this is a little
scary for hopes that the Decadal Review report will push funding for ATA
expansion as preliminary SKA work.  Another thing that disappointed me was
that the group didn’t spend any time discussing “state of the profession”
issues like the ones discussed in [the whitepaper I helped
write](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2571). This didn’t surprise me at all, but I
still wish more people out there (especially the leaders of the community)
would be more engaged in thinking about, well, the state of the profession. We
can certainly continue to limp along as we have for a long time, but I feel
like there’s a tremendous room to improve the system, if only a bit more
money, time and effort would be put in that direction.
