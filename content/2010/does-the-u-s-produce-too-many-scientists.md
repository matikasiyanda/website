Hot on the heels of Nature’s Astro2010 Decadal Review mini-panel not
discussing career issues, I was pointed to an article in Scientific American
that does just that:
[“Does the U.S. Produce Too Many Scientists?”](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-us-produce-too-m)
by Beryl Lieff Benderly.

The article’s response to its titular question is a strong “yes”, in contrast
to their assertion (not backed up too strongly, but certainly believable) that
most people you’d ask would say “no”. The juicy counterintuitive conclusion is
obtained by analyzing the question in a relatively narrow way: how many PhDs
do we mint or import compared to the number of faculty positions there are? Of
course, as also detailed in
[the whitepaper I helped write](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2571), there answer
is “a lot more”. If every PhD ought to obtain a faculty position — which is a
big “if” — then yes, it’s pretty clear that we do indeed produce too many
scientists.

Benderly touches a bit on the “if” and mentions a few of the career-path
issues that are also raised in the whitepaper. The very comparison of “number
of PhDs” versus “number of faculty spots” is indicative of how narrow the
thinking typically is when it comes to career trajectories for a PhD.

The article also focuses on “science” as an activity only performed by
PhDs in research labs. Obviously there are issues with this but I imagine that
Benderly was well aware of them and simply needed to keep the article somewhat
focused. That being said, there are a few sidenotes touching on issues beyond
the research-class world that seem a bit off to me. For instance, discussing
the quality of American primary and secondary education:

> Raising America’s average scores on international comparisons is, therefore,
> not a matter of repairing a broken educational system that performs poorly
> overall, as many critiques suggest, but rather of improving the performance
> of the children at the bottom, overwhelmingly from low-income families and
> racial and ethnic minorities. This discrepancy, of course, is a vital
> national need and responsibility, but it does not reflect an overall
> insufficient supply of able science students.

I guess I agree with the second sentence — we can get away with a lot since we
have a large population. But the first sentence seems completely misguided to
me. Privileged students are always going to perform just fine given a system
that isn’t pathologically flawed — the fact that our system fails
underprivileged students precisely shows that it’s broken.

Then the article closes with:

> The real crisis in American science education is not young Americans’
> inability to learn, or the schools’ inability to teach, but a distorted job
> market’s inability to provide them careers worthy of their abilities.

I like the emphasis at the ending here on the career options for PhDs, and
yes, the article does focus on PhDs, but really? “The real crisis in American
science education”? I’m pretty sure the real crisis in American science
education is that most Americans have a shockingly poor grasp of the basic
facts that science has taught us about the natural world and a profound
ignorance regarding how and why the scientific process is successful. The real
crisis in American science education is that many science teachers (bless
their souls!) are not qualified to teach the subjects they teach. The real
crisis in American science education is that schools don’t have enough money
for the necessary educational materials and many students don’t have enough
time and stability outside of school to study. Those are the real crises.
