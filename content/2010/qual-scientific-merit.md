(First deadline: blown. I ended up taking on a few more topics in this post
than I originally envisioned.)

For my thesis, I’m observing the dynamic radio sky. The centerpiece project is
a search for radio transients towards the Galactic Center, the ATA Galatic
Center Transient Survey (AGCTS). A second major component is monitoring of
Cygnus X-3. As we find interesting things in the both of these datasets, we’ll
pursue them in focused, smaller-bore scientific projects.

This post is about whether these are interesting projects to pursue. To be
honest, the two pieces are pretty independent of each other, so I’ll treat
them independently.

# AGCTS

Is a search for galactic radio transients scientifically compelling? The
abstract argument is that systematic surveys of the variability of the radio
sky (as opposed to its constant component) are very new, and every time a new
way of probing the sky has been developed, significant discoveries have been
made.

It’s important to pinpoint what’s new: _surveys_ of the radio sky for
variability, rather than _monitoring_ of particular radio sources for
variability. Due to the technological limitations of radio astronomy, the
former are just becoming feasible, but the latter has been around for a while,
often in much more sophisticated form than it has for other wavebands.
(_E.g._, pulsars.) As best I can see, we should think about this distinction
being about a vastly increased ability to _discover_, rather than _monitor_,
radio-variable sources. So, would it be exciting to find more of these
sources? Here are some of the kinds of objects that we might find, with the
galactic ones italicized:

- _Pulsars_
- _RRATs_ (if worth distinguishing from pulsars)
- _Flare
stars_
- _Brown dwarfs_
- Non-variable sources subject to interstellar scintillation (could be either
  galactic or XG, but likelier to be XG since depends on chance alignments and
  there are more XG radio sources by areal density — I think this line of
  argument is valid)
- ESEs (distinct from above?)
- RSNe
- (O)GRBAs
- _XRBs_
- AGN
- _Masers_ (also XG; not relevant here since we’re working in the continuum)
- _Objects of unknown nature that have been discovered in radio
  transient/variable surveys or serendipitously_ (there are suggestions that
  at least some of these are galactic:
  [Becker+ 2010](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140..157B), though
  they don’t consider scintillation; the Burper; Galactic Center transients; etc.)

I think that list speaks for itself. Now, even if there are many interesting
radio-variable sources, it’s not necessarily worthwhile to hunt for them by
surveys of radio variability, especially if we consider source classes in
isolation. Assessing this worthwhileness blocks on my looking into feasibility
— though, of course, a radio variability survey is the only path to
discovering radio variables of an unknown nature.

# AGCTS Novelty

Another aspect “interestingness” is whether the AGCTS is novel and competitive
with other ongoing efforts. We certainly _hope_ that the answer is yes: the
ATA is supposed to be a unique instrument for performing surveys of this kind.
The more detailed answer depends upon consideration of the competition:

- Cordes Arecibo pulsar survey:
  [2006](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...637..446C)

The last two are concerned with fast transients, which is a pretty different
region of parameter space than what I’m interested in. All of the others
except for the first three are concerned with extragalactic sources, whereas
I’m interested in the galactic population. The NRAO GPA survey never published
any transient results. That leaves the Hyman and Becker works. I’m working on
comparing the expected AGCTS results with these two projects — this gets a
little hairy, and ties in with feasibility questions, so I’m OK with this
aspect needing a bit more investigation.

# Cyg X-3

Are microquasars interesting? Definitely — they should be able to teach us a
lot about full- size quasars. (See eg
[Mirabel & Rodriguez 1998](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Natur.392..673M)
for a short version of the case and
[Mirabel & Rodriguez 1999](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ARA%26A..37..409M)
for a review article that also goes into justifications.) Fundamentally, while
many of the physics seem to be analogous, the timescales are much, much
shorter and the spatial resolution is much, much better. And there’s
definitely a lot that we still don’t understand about accretion disks and
relativistic jets.

Is it interesting to monitor the radio variability of a microquasar? Well,
empirically, yes, because people are doing it.

- Cyg X-3 is being monitored with the OVRO 40m by Fermi LAT Collaboration
  members (mentioned in
  [FLC 2009](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Sci...326.1512F), no direct ref
  I can find)
- Ditto for with AMI (e.g.
  [Pooley 2006](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006smqw.confE..19P))
- And the RATAN-600 (mentioned in
  [Tavani+ 2009](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2009Natur.462..620T),
  no direct ref)

How is our project different than these? The OVRO monitoring seems to generate
one flux measurement every few days. The AMI monitoring has bursts where they
get fluxes every ~hour but generally is at the same cadence. RATAN seems to
have a 2-day cadence. We, on the other hand, are aiming to get fluxes on a
5-to-10-minute cadence. At least some of these measurements are simultaneous
with X-ray and observations.

Will this different approach yield novel results? This also starts getting a
bit tricky to address, and starts getting into the “feasibility” domain.
[Szostek and Zdziarski 2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2007MNRAS.375..793S)
argue that there won’t be orbital modulation of Cyg X-3’s emission, but not
because of scattering effects, so shorter-timescale variability would still be
possible due to _e.g._ jet variability.
[Hjalmarsdotter+ 2004](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2004RMxAC..20..216H)
says that periods between 0.01 and 1000 days were searched for in a Ryle
telescope run around 2002 Dec 22-23 and that none were found, with no word on
what the variability may have looked like. (Given the lower limit to their
period search, they were probably sampling every 0.005 d ~= 8 min.) This is a
little worrisome, but given the skimpiness of that reference and the others
above, it looks like no one has really sat down and looked at the radio
variability of Cyg X-3 on timescales of less than a day — for instance,
there’s no word as to what the Cyg X-3 radio variability looked like just as a
simple time series. We’ll also have simultaneous and near-simultaneous X-ray
data, so I think there’s ample opportunity for us to find something
interesting that others haven’t. Unfortunately, before the reduced data are in
hand, it’s hard to predict what, if anything, we might find.

# Spinoffs

Another point in favor of the projects I’m proposing is that they have good
potential for spinoffs. Firstly and most obviously, if we find anything
interesting, we can follow it up and try to do some science with the
particular results. Secondly, we’ll generate static sky maps as byproducts,
and those should be interesting in their own right. We expect to have 200 MHz
of bandwidth centered on 3.09 GHz, so there should be some leverage on
spectral indices. We should also land in a nice medium-resolution point, with
larger area covered than high-resolution surveys but much better resolution
previous radio surveys covering a similar area. With the Cyg X-3 project,
while the main goal is to get good Cyg X-3 lightcurves, we should be able to
search for transients using the AGCTS pipeline pretty easily. The Cygnus
region is very crowded so it’s a good place to look for galactic transients
too.
