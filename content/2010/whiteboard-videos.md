Lately everybody seems to be making hip web videos explaining things on
whiteboards:  *   [Austen Goolsbee on tax cut
legislation](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/09/30/white-house-white-
board-cea-chair-austan-goolsbee-explains-tax-cut-fight) (via [Ezra
Klein](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-
klein/2010/09/charts_and_graphs_that_will_fi_3.html)) *   [Monty Mongomery on
the technical principles underlying digital
media](http://www.xiph.org/video/vid1.shtml) *   [Steven Johnson on “Where
Good Ideas Come From”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugRZGDbPFU) *   [David
Harvey on “The Crises of Capitalism”](http://anthronow.com/in-print/crises-of-
capitalism-by-an-animated-david-harvey)  I like this trend, since the
whiteboard approach seems to help people enhance their presentations with
graphics while avoiding full-on PowerPoint-driven slidesanity. But it
surprises me that these presenters seem to actually be drawing complicated
graphs on actual whiteboards with actual markers. Surely it’s easier to render
some of these graphics digitally? Perhaps it’s harder than I think to set up a
poor man’s greenscreen? I wonder.
