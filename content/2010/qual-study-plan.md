Here’s a quick post on my study plan for the next month. Here’s my breakdown
of the topics I need to spend time on:

- “Astronomy 201” radiative transfer topics (esp. synchrotron, free-free,
  etc.) Allot about three days.
- Radio (astro)physics, thinking about radio receivers, diffraction,
  scintillation, other relevant astrophysical processes. (Dividing line
  between this grouping and the above is not necessarily clear.) Allot about 2
  days.
- The fundamentals of interferometry. 2 days.
- General statistics / formalisms for thinking about astrophysical transients.
  2 days.
- The radio transient zoo, particularly galactic transients. 5 days.
- Microquasars. 4 days.
- Starforming galaxies, the FIR/radio correlation, and related topics. 3 days.

And here’s a rough study schedule with a few revised milestones for the runup
to the exam:

- **Aug 9-13**. Study interferometry, Astro 201
- **Aug 16-20**. Study the radio transient zoo, transient formalisms.
- **Aug 23-27**. Study microquasars.
- **Aug 27**. Finish first-draft talk slides.
- **Aug 30 – Sep 3**. Study FIR/radio, radio (astro)physics
- **~Aug 30**. Give practice talk to Geoff.
- **~Sep 1**. Give practice talk to grads/postdocs.
- **Sep 8**. Take qual.
