What’s the plan between now and graduation? Here’s the simple view:

- **Fall 2010:** Cygnus X-3 paper
- **Spring 2011:** work on AGCTS fast-bright transient search; some kind of
  publication on my software efforts
- **Fall 2011:** have AGCTS FBTS submitted; job applications; begin work on
  AGCTS static map / slow-faint transient search
- **Spring 2012:** finish AGCTS SFTS

Some commentary:

- If we detect a transient, we’ll almost definitely write a paper about it,
  especially if we detect it soon after it appears and not months after. If
  that happens, the schedule will change, but obviously I can’t predict how
  that all might play out.
- We don’t have a great idea about what venue would be best for a
  software-related publication, but there’s strong agreement that I should get
  something out there one way or another. The timing of this is pretty
  flexible, but the sooner it’s published, the more time there is for people
  to (hopefully) start adopting the work that I’ve done.
- The AGCTS fast-bright / slow-faint papers will be based on the same dataset.
  The former will be a somewhat cruder comparison of the night-to-night
  observations and a search for transients there. The latter will average down
  the data more and look for fainter, slower-evolving transients. This is the
  opposite approach taken by ATATS. I have two factors in mind here: first,
  it’ll be more exciting to find a ~week-timescale transient if we do find
  anything, and doing so is a high priority for the ATA. Secondly, with our
  target being the hard-to-image GC region, averaging together the longer
  datasets to get higher-quality images will probably be challenging and might
  offer a lot less improvement than we’d hope. So, we’ll try sacrificing some
  hypothetical sensitivity in favor of checking for exciting objects and
  dealing with imaging in a somewhat less demanding situation.

So the plan calls for four papers in two years, which is ambitious, although
1) the software paper should be pretty easy and 2) I’ve been working on the
Cyg X-3 project for a while now, and it’s intended to be a relatively
small-bore effort.

What will I need to do for the science papers?

- **Cyg X-3**. Raw data are in hand, analysis pipeline is maybe 75% done. The
  full dataset needs to be crunched. We need to get the X-ray, gamma, and
  radio data into a single database and examine the behavior. We need to be on
  the lookout for another flare (happen every ~6 months) and get a bunch of
  good data when one happens. (Assuming that the next flare isn’t 3σ late.)
  Besides flare data, there are some physics questions to think about: can we
  constrain the gamma/radio delay to better than Fermi’s 5 ± 7 d? Can we say
  anything about the potential precession of the Cyg X-3 jet, and possibly the
  position of the radio emission in the system?
- **AGCTS BFTS**. Have a lot of data. The pipeline will share a lot with
  what’s developed for Cyg X-3; transient detection will take some work but
  can hopefully build on Steve’s experience with ATATS. The primary science
  question is: what is the rate of bright, ~weeklong Galactic radio
  transients? If we find any, we’ll look into them. We’ll discuss the
  calibration and analysis strategies needed for dealing with this complex
  field. That’s really about it. I’ll need to think about how to set upper
  rates for limits based on a null result (being pessimistic) and how to slice
  and dice along different sensitivity limits / integration times (following
  Bower+ 2008).
- **AGCTS SFTS**. Hopefully, this will build upon the analyzed data for the
  BFTS. Calibration will have to be more careful to push sensitivity limits.
  It will presumably be worthwhile to look at the static maps and think about
  what can be done with them scientifically. Other than that, the scientific
  analysis should be strongly similar to the previous paper.

Just gotta take care of those little things and I’m done!
