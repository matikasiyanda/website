I’m giving another rendition of my radio astronomy talk, to the [Sonoma County
Astronomical Society](http://www.sonomaskies.org/), on Wednesday, July 14th,
at 7:30 PM. The talk will take place at the [Proctor Terrace
School](http://www.srcs.k12.ca.us/schools/location.asp?TBLCODE=PRTR) in Santa
Rosa. The abstract is once again identical to that of [September’s
edition](/%7Epeter/?p=160). See you then!
