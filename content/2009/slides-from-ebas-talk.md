And I do mean _slides_. I’ve uploaded a
[PDF version](/~peter/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/EBAS-Talk-June-2009.pdf)
(15 MB) of the slides, but they are essentially useless without knowing the
plan of the talk, since there’s virtually no text on the slides. I found that
this situation arose pretty naturally from my strategy of outlining the talk
on paper first and then assembling supporting graphics afterward.

I’ve tried to be as thorough as possible about the image credits, but many of
the images are probably incorrectly attributed or not permitted to be
republished. That’s life out on the wilds of the internet, though. My diagrams
and the talk as a whole are licensed as … let’s say a
