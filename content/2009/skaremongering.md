A while back an interesting paper appeared on
[astro- ph](http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/recent), the astrophysics preprint
server:
[“Large Instrument Development for Radio Astronomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3826)“,
by J. R. Fisher and others who appear to be radio engineers at the
[National Radio Astronomy Observatory](http://www.nrao.edu/). It’s a
whitepaper submitted to the
[Astro2010 decadal review](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810)
and I think it’s fair to summarize it as a shot at the
[Square Kilometer Array](http://www.skatelescope.org/) concept.

The whitepaper doesn’t explicitly name the SKA but that’s _clearly_ what it’s
about. The basic argument is of the “let’s not be hasty” form — it takes time
to develop new technologies, combining multiple scientific goals in one
observatory is difficult, the costs of complex designs can quickly get out of
hand, and so on. The SKA concept, which envisions serious progress in many
areas of radio astronomical engineering and pretty much aspires to be the
Greatest Radio Telescope For Everyone Evar as well as By Far The Most
Expensive Radio Telescope Evar certainly calls for lots of new technologies
and a complex design.

I’m sympathetic to pretty much all of their arguments. Building the largest
radio telescope ever with new, incompletely-understood technology would, I
think, be a really bad idea. From what I’ve seen, “all-in-wonder” designs for
any technological system are usually a red flag — flexibility almost always
comes at the cost of clean, simple, and correct functionality for any
particular purpose. World-class hardware and software engineering is _hard_
and takes time.

That being said, their arguments are the same ones that are always used to
discourage innovations. “Oh, it’s risky, it’ll take a long time, we understand
the existing stuff so much better.” These arguments are often valid, but
technology wouldn’t be much fun if they were _always_ heeded. Of course, “fun”
shouldn’t be the operative word when you’re talking about a
multi-billion-dollar investment. But in the case of the SKA, there’s no way to
build the telescope without requiring some innovation. In the terminology of
the whitepaper, it’s just a question of how much risk you’ve retired before
you start building it.

In the particular case of the SKA, I’m not sure what I think. One thing is the
fact that there’s a _long_ development path leading to the SKA itself —
pathfinders and prototypes and precursors, oh my. A lot of work is already
happening to build and test the kinds of systems that would be involved in the
SKA. It’s not as if ground is going to be broken on the final thing before a
detailed design has been worked out and thought through. There won’t be any
prototype fully-functioning observatories with thousands of antennas, but I
think the basic issues involved in scaling up a large array to a huge array
are low-risk: a lot of the requirements are parallelizable, and if you
understand a good-sized batch of antennas well, you can understand how a much
larger batch is going to behave.

On the other hand, a project as big as the SKA tends to develop its own
inertia. If, after another decade of work, there’s trouble on all of the
engineering fronts, no one’s going to want to (or even be able to?) just abort
the whole project. For small R&D projects, you can say, “OK, it didn’t work,
that’s good to know,” but when you’re planning to spend a few billion dollars,
the plug just doesn’t get pulled. And in that case, you could be spending lots
of money on a telescope that will be merely OK when that money could have been
spent on several projects that would have each been great.

Maybe it’s best to think of the SKA like a space mission. Space missions are
expensive and risky, so you always see that they deploy pretty unexciting
telescope technologies; they get their science leverage from whatever
application-specific advantage is provided by being in space. The SKA is also
expensive and risky since the upfront capital investment will be so large. So
in all probability it will likewise deploy technology that will be boring by
the time SKA construction starts; this is OK since the SKA gets its science
leverage by being really huge. In this case, the question is, is it possible
to deploy boring technology in the SKA model? I think so, since the key pieces
are the antennas, feeds, and communications links — those are the things that
you really, really don’t want to have to replace _en masse_. And those are
eminently testable in smaller configurations. So hooray, the SKA will work out
fine! Good thing we figured that out.
