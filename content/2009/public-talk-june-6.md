I’ve agreed to give a talk on June 6 to the [Eastbay Astronomical
Society](http://www.eastbayastro.org/). The title and abstract are:

> *Exploring the Invisible Universe: The Past and Future of Radio Astronomy*
>
> Visible-light astronomy has been practiced for millennia. Astronomical
> observations of radio waves are, in comparison, still a novelty. Over its
> short lifespan, however, the field of radio astronomy has still managed to
> produce some of the most impressive results of modern science, including the
> discovery of extrasolar molecules and the detection of cosmic microwave
> background radiation, the key piece of evidence for the Big Bang. In this
> talk I’ll discuss the basics of radio astronomy, what can be seen in the
> radio sky, and the different ways in which astronomy is done at optical and
> radio frequencies. I’ll also talk about what we can expect from radio
> astronomy in the near and not-so-near future: an exciting convergence of
> recent technological advances promises do as much for radio astronomy as the
> invention of the CCD has done for visible-light astronomy. Special focus
> will be put on the Allen Telescope Array, a new telescope jointly operated
> by UC Berkeley and the SETI Institute, which exemplifies some of these
> advances.

This will be my first public talk as well as my first hour-long talk. I think
I know what I want to talk about, and I’m pretty sure I can string it all
together in a non-boring way, so I’m looking forward to it. I’m not so much
looking forward to how much time it’ll take to prepare everything, but I want
this to be good so I’ll take the time to do it right.
