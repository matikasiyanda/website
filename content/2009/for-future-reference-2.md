A [straightforward explanation](http://home.earthlink.net/~llica/wichthat.htm)
of the grammatical distinction between “which” and “that”.

Probably not necessary to note this here, seeing as it was the first Google
hit for “which that distinction”, but I liked that the page happened to be
aimed specifically at scientists. I also like the general tone of the pages,
and the MS-DOS-style 8.3 filenames (_e.g._, `yqal2rit.htm`) are kind of
touching.
