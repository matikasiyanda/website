I found this [cute post](http://ed.fnal.gov/projects/scientists/) linked to
from the
[Berkeley Science Review blog](http://sciencereview.dreamhosters.com/blog/) —
it’s a set of pictures and descriptions of scientists made by a group of
seventh graders, before and after a visit to FermiLab. Before: “hair standing
straight up and a mean wicked laugh”. After: “Actually, scientists are normal
people that lead normal lives.” There must have been some orchestrated
brainwashing on the visit they went on, but I can’t fault the FermiLab folks
for doing a little PR.

What caught my eye was how most of the students drew scientists as being of
their own gender. In particular, most of the female students drew pictures of
female scientists. Certainly not what I’d have expected to have seen, but a
pleasant surprise.
