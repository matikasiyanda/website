I gave a poster at the [213th AAS meeting](http://aas.org/meetings/aas213/)
about my broadband spectra project. The poster abstract is now
[listed on ADS.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AAS...21347005W)

Hereâ€™s
[a PDF of the poster](/~peter/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/poster.pdf)
(2.8 MB). The expected caveats apply: this is unpublished, preliminary work,
and it represents results that will be, and in fact already have been,
superseded. But it captures what I presented at the conference.
