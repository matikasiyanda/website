Well, I didn’t do a very good job of giving advance notice, but I’m giving a
public talk tomorrow to the [Peninsula Astronomical
Society](http://www.foothill.fhda.edu/ast/pas.htm) in Los Altos. The topic and
description are the same as that of the talk I gave in June:  > Exploring the
Invisible Universe: The Past and Future of Radio Astronomy >
------------------------------------------------------------------------ >  >
Visible-light astronomy has been practiced for millennia. Astronomical
observations of radio waves are, in comparison, still a novelty. Over its
short lifespan, however, the field of radio astronomy has still managed to
produce some of the most impressive results of modern science, including the
discovery of extrasolar molecules and the detection of cosmic microwave
background radiation, the key piece of evidence for the Big Bang. In this talk
I’ll discuss the basics of radio astronomy, what can be seen in the radio sky,
and the different ways in which astronomy is done at optical and radio
frequencies. I’ll also talk about what we can expect from radio astronomy in
the near and not-so-near future: an exciting convergence of recent
technological advances promises do as much for radio astronomy as the
invention of the CCD has done for visible-light astronomy. Special focus will
be put on the contributions of Bay Area institutions, including UC Berkeley
and the SETI Institute.  I was pretty happy with the previous version of the
talk, so I’ll only make a few changes to it. Should be a good time.
