My colleague Steve Croft got sent a [“Flat
Stanley”](http://www.flatstanley.com/) a little while ago. I hadn’t heard of
the Flat Stanley Project before — it’s an outreach initiative in which kids
print out a cartoony paper man, color him in, and mail him off somewhere
interesting. “Stanley” is given a tour of what goes on and the kids get a
report of what he experienced. Steve wrote his report as [a blog
post](http://flatastronomer.blogspot.com/).
