I’m an astronomer at the
[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/).
These days I spend most of my time studying “extrasolar magnetospheres” — the
magnetic fields of cool bodies beyond the Solar System. My work has shown that
very small stars and also “brown dwarfs,” the balls of gas that are between
stars and planets in size, have magnetic fields that are quite similar to the
ones we find planets around Earth and Jupiter — they’re just hundreds of times
stronger! These magnetic fields drive a rich phenomenology of space plasma
physics and tell us about the internal structure of these bodies.

It’s usually hard to detect a magnetic field from afar, but extrasolar
magnetospheres are commonly associated with
“[auroral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora)” processes that are exactly
what they sound like: scaled-up versions of our own Northern and Southern
Lights. We can’t detect visible light from these processes, but it turns out
that they also produce distinctive bursts of radio emission that are so
intense that we can detect them at interstellar distances (the Earth analog is
called [AKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroral_kilometric_radiation)). My
core scientific training is in the field of
[radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy) and I have
long been involved in the broader radio astronomical community.

One of the most exciting trends in this area is the push to be able to study
smaller and smaller bodies, with the goal of studying the magnetic fields of
planets around other stars. We really have no idea what other planets’
magnetic fields might look like, but they mediate the interaction between
planets’ atmospheres and their host stars’ winds, so understanding
exoplanetary magnetic fields is a key element of understanding
[habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability). We
expect the radio bursts from _bona fide_ planets to come at relatively low
radio frequencies, so I have become the lead time-domain scientist of the
[Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array](http://reionization.org/), HERA, a
low-frequency radio telescope under construction in South Africa. While HERA’s
main scientific goal is literally about probing
[the other end of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization),
HERA also has the right attributes to be an amazing planetary magnetometer.

Studying the magnetic fields of very small stars also sheds light on some
broader features of stellar astrophysics. I investigate the aging and internal
structures of the smallest stars by combining my radio observations with data
in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray taken with a whole host of
observatories, from
[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) to
[Chandra](http://chandra.harvard.edu/) to
[ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/).

I got into this work through the field of “time-domain radio astronomy,” the
general study of changes in the radio sky. We have long known that the radio
sky is a dynamic place, sometimes with
[Nobel-prize-worthy consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar), but
the technological developments of the past couple of decades have transformed
our ability to study it. One of the most exciting breakthroughs in this area
is the unexpected discovery of
[Fast Radio Bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst) (FRBs),
extremely bright and rapid pulses of radio emission that have signatures
suggesting they come from well across the Universe. I’m working to pin down
the origins of FRBs by understanding the astrophysical context in which they
arise.

Finally, I’ve always been interested in computers, scientific communication,
and especially the intersection between the two. I
[write my talks in HTML](http://newton.cx/~peter/2013/09/slides-for-scientific-talks-in-html/)
which allows me to include
[fancy interactive animations](https://newton.cx/~peter/2017/07/variable-and-polarized-radio-emission-from-the-t6-brown-dwarf-wisep-j112254-73255021-5/).
I have spent more time in the guts of [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
than any person really ought to, including launching the
[Tectonic Project](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/), which extends and
reworks TeX in some key ways with the goal of providing the 21st-century
typesetting system for technical documents — both print and electronic — that
scientists, engineers, and in fact _everyone_ deserves.

Because there are a lot of P. Williamses out there, I try to go by Peter K. G.
Williams in [my publications](http://newton.cx/%7Epeter/pubs/).

I also do things that aren’t science! But this isn’t the website for talking
about that.
