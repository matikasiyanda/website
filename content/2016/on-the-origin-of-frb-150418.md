Recently,
[a _Nature_ paper by Keane et al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7591/full/nature17140.html)
came out claiming a precise localization for a Fast Radio Burst, FRB 150418,
implying a cosmological distance and likely origin in a compact object merger.
My boss Edo Berger and I believe that this interpretation cannot be justified
by the data, and have written
{{ulink(path="wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/note-rev1.pdf", text="this note")}}
describing our reasoning. More anon once we get some data to test our claims!
