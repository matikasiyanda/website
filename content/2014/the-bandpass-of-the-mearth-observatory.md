I recently found myself wanting to know the (approximate) bandpass of the
[MEarth](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/MEarth/) observatory. A plot of the
bandpass is published in
[Nutzman & Charbonneau (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008PASP..120..317N),
but I wasnâ€™t able to find any tabulated data. Fortunately, the MEarth team
works down the hallway from me, so I could find out if there were any better
options. The short story is, not really.
[Jonathan Irwin](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~jirwin/) kindly sent me some of
the underlying data, which I used to compute a bandpass. I wrote up my method
and results in an [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which
is shown statically below.
