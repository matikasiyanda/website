title = "A Brief Review of Radio Emission from Ultracool Dwarfs"
+++

Last year I was invited to write a chapter for the Springer’s sprawling
[Handbook of Exoplanets](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319553320), a
3,400-page compendium summarizing the state of the field of exoplanet science.
Unsurprisingly, the topic I was asked to write about was “Radio Emission from
Ultracool Dwarfs.”

I decided to treat this invitation as an opportunity to write a brief review
of the field, since there’s been a lot of progress in the past five years but,
frankly, it’s not a field that’s big enough to draw the attention of a journal
like the
[Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://www.annualreviews.org/journal/astro).

Writing the chapter was a lot of fun! And, if I may say so myself, I hope that
it gives a clear and concise introduction to the field and explanation of why
it’s important. I tried to be careful to delineate between what the
observations are, what our best-bet interpretations are, and the implications
of those interpretations — paying special attention, of course, to the
implications for exoplanets. I think there will be a lot of attention directed
towards these objects in the coming years, since they are simultaneously
easy-to-study *analogues* of massive exoplanets, while potentially important
*hosts* of smaller exoplanets.

For better or for worse, there are two versions of the document that might be
of interest:

- [The official published version](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30648-3_171-1)
  (DOI:[10.1007/978-3-319-30648-3_171-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30648-3_171-1)),
  published online earlier this year, which is behind a paywall.
- [A version on arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04264)
  ([arXiv:1707.04264](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04264)), uploaded in
  July 2017, which is somewhat expanded from the official version and is
  freely available.

I hope you’ll check them out!
