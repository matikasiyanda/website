Well, it’s finally official. As of today I am no longer a postdoc, but rather
have been appointed the Innovation Scientist for the
[Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu/) and the
[American Astronomical Society](https://aas.org/)!

You might ask: “What’s an Innovation Scientist?” Good question! This is a new
role created at the CfA and AAS thanks to the vision and leadership of
[Charles Alcock](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/charles-r-alcock),
director of the CfA, [Kevin Marvel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinmarvel/),
executive officer of the AAS, and especially
[Prof. Alyssa Goodman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~agoodman/) of the Harvard
Department of Astronomy. The basic context is this: it is clear that the new
technologies of the 21st century offer an immense opportunity to transform the
research enterprise for the better. We want to seize this opportunity. But it
is also clear that working scientists are — and should remain — too focused on
their specialities to be able to chase every new fad that comes out of Silicon
Valley. Many scientists are, of course, pushing the cutting edge of technology
forward every day — but in ways specific to their particular fields. Meanwhile
there’s just as much room for advancement, if not more, in applying new
technologies to *the ways we do research itself*.

Enter the Innovation Scientist. I view my job as *helping make other
astronomers’ jobs easier*. This might mean that I put together workshops to
train CfA graduate students in the principles of scientific software
engineering. It might mean that I help faculty identify and pursue novel
funding opportunities to support their innovative ideas. It might mean that I
build a new software tool myself, something that will help researchers be a
little bit more productive every day but that no one person is strongly
motivated to turn into a widely-usable product. The role certainly focuses on
technology, but I think that it’s important to take a broad perspective. Not
every problem can be solved with a gadget, and the word “technology” is not
synonymous with “microchips.”

My duties will be split between the CfA and the AAS, which is going to be fun
(if a little hairy logistically). I’m excited to become involved in the AAS
since it works on behalf of the whole US astronomical community, and so is the
natural home for community-wide resources. Two such resources that I’m
particularly interested in are the AAS journals,
[which strive to innovate their delivery for the 21st century](https://journals.aas.org/why-aas-journals/)
while being run for the benefit of the whole community, and the AAS
[WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/) project, a powerful
all-sky visualization engine. Today I also became the Director of the
WorldWide Telescope, and I’m looking forward to seeing the awesome research
and education tools that we can help the community build with it over the
coming years.

Meanwhile, on the CfA side, I’ll be working side-by-side with excellent
researchers, in many fields and at all career stages, at one of the top
astrophysics institutes in the world. In particular, there’s a lot of great
buzzword-compliant work going on at the CfA: we’ve got teams doing
cutting-edge work with Big Data, data science, machine learning, the whole
gamut. I’m going to help these teams get their hands on the tools, training,
and funding they need to do the best work they can. I’m particularly keen to
see what bridges I can build, both between different teams here at the CfA and
among the broader Harvard community. We all know that “interdisciplinary”
sounds cool but is hard to pull off in practice — but I’m convinced that there
really are great treasures to be discovered in interdisciplinary-land, and I’m
excited to try to unearth them.

I’ve spent the past several years searching for a “post-postdoc” job, and I’ve
been open about the fact that my search focused on faculty jobs. After the
sixty-ninth rejection, I decided that it was time to focus on different paths,
even though I was pessimistic that I would be able to find something that had
autonomy, stability, and frankly prestige competitive with the tenure track.
Thankfully, my pessimism was excessive! I still think that academia needs to
create more roles with long-term stability for researchers outside the tenure
track, but they are out there — especially if you’re simultaneously strong in
research and technology. Honestly, I’m not feeling much in the way of regret
about what might have been. Who knows what the future holds, but I’m very
excited to start this new stage in my career and find out where it will take
me.
