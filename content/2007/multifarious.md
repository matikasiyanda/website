A few different things today. ATA meeting, CIPS seminar, broadband spectra
reduction, some more blue-sky coding on a sort of Miriad data file index. I
guess that’s not really too many different things. Anyway, I’m optimistic that
the Miriad indexing code will be very useful soon. I’m going to use it to work
on automatic flagging algorithms that will analyze not just a single dataset
but all of the data from an entire observing run to find patterns of bad vis
entries. The exact difficulty of this problem is unclear to me, but I think
that I can make some nice gains without too much additional work, and the
index should allow extremely sophisticated data processing if I want it. Oh,
and really fast, too.  **Addendum:** Fucking flat tire! Fuck! I want to go
home!
