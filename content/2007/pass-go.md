Star formation problem set today. Not terribly difficult this time around. I
was asked to write the solution set, so I had to prep my answers in LaTeX, but
really I don’t think that makes me go much slower than writing things out by
hand — I can crank out the math expressions pretty quickly.  Friday was a lot
of ground work in getting set up to reduce ATA data on-site using my tools. I
think this will be important to really get the most out of the data that I’m
obtaining. Looking forward to getting a chance to continue working on that,
but tomorrow will, as usual, be busy with optical lab and class, so things
will probably have to wait a bit longer than that.
