Last Thursday was the long-awaited and much-worried-about dedication ceremony
for the ATA. It was basically a purely PR event, but that’s not to say that it
wasn’t meaningful. The array’s operations were no different the day after the
ceremony than they were the day before it, but to my mind there were two
important functions served by the dedication. First of all, the PR payoff —
both to the donors and the broader public — is not something to be taken
lightly. As a scientist one would rather not have to worry about raising funds
to complete one’s projects, but it’s a fact of life that that’s necessary.
Secondly, it was good to get all of the ATA contributors together to meet each
other and mark what’s been accomplished to this point. There’s still a whole
lot to do, but there’s a lot to be proud of. Of course, I was thinking about
this, and I decided that of all of the ATA contributors present at the
ceremony, I was probably the single person who has done the least to help the
project. This isn’t something that I’m embarassed about — I certainly could
have contributed more by this point, but there’s no shame in not having put in
as much work as the engineers and scientists who’ve been working on things
full-time for several years now. But it does put things in perspective.

Today was star formation homework. Could have figured out a couple of
integrals faster, but that doesn’t bother me too much either.
