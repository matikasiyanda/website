Spent some time fighting with my broadband spectra data today. Only really
looked at Cas A at 1440 MHz in XX and YY pols; XX yields poor a image, while
YY yields junk. I spent some time trying to figure out why that was, with no
luck. The dataset isn’t obviously crap or anything, and while it has fewer
data points, I think it should still have enough to get something resembling a
point source out of the inversoin. I’ll try a few nearby frequencies to see if
YY is consistently problematic. If it’s just a one-off thing I’ll worry about
it later. (Frequencies near 1420 MHz are good because there’s an FCC ban on
radio emissions in that frequency region. This is actually a favor to radio
astronomers; the very important molecular hydrogen hyperfine transition line
is at 1420 MHz.)

Then a lot of lab. People were mostly doing their thing so I spent the time
making a pretty picture. The result is to the left, hopefully. (Image handling
in WordPress seems kinda wonky. Looks like the image actually shows up on the
right. Also, there doesn’t seem to be any automatic thumbnailing, so I had to
shrink the image a bit. Right-click on the image and choose “View Image” or
something analogous to see the full-size version.) Could be better, but not
bad for a night’s work.
