Took care of a lot of odds and ends today. Did a little more analysis of ATA
gains — swallowed my pride and used Gnuplot to make a histogram of the
calculated antenna gains. Which at least had the useful effect of reminding me
why I wrote OmegaPlot in the first place. Anyway, there’s apparently another
similar data set available, so I’ll find gains for that and hopefully things
won’t be wildly different.

Went down to the basement to be shown how to use the Nickel’s remote observing
capabilities by Franck Marchis. Unfortunately, there’s a wildfire near Lick
right now, so we weren’t able to open the dome. On the other hand, that gave
us an excuse to spend time getting a bunch of dome flats. We’ll use these for
the next lab; the students will use the frames that we took to make a classic
CCD linearity plot. From our quick look at the data, this will be a snap.

Did some reading for Galactic Dynamics and picked a problem, but didn’t really
pay much attention. There was a bunch of math with potentials, and,
[like Thea](http://somethinglikeanastronomer.blogspot.com/2007/09/monday-news.html),
it turns out I don’t think I know how to calculate surface densities. That’s
about the extent of what I absorbed from it.

Looked at the Star Formation problem set. Looks like a good set (yes, I feel
like I have an eye as to the quality of the construction of a problem set by
now) though probably going to be more work than I’d prefer. But ain’t that
always how it is.
