As usual, lots of lab today. The story for the past few days has been
uncertainties; people seem to be fine with the basic concepts but don’t feel
comfortable just plunging ahead and working things out. I certainly know that
feeling (see: tensors) so I am not going to criticize it.

Got a chance to look at my broadband spectra data today. As usual, seizing up
trying to  figure out what’s good, what’s recoverable with some flagging, and
what’s seriously damaged. Better tools would help, I think, but the main issue
is the same sort of confidence in your intuition that I was just talking
about. How convenient is that?
