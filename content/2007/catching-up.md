Most of today was SF homework. Happy with the result, though, as always, took
longer than it felt it should have.

Had a tiny little bit of time to look at my broadband spectra data.
Annoyingly, I have to spend some time thinking about network logistics: there
are about 30 gigs of data at Hat Creek, and limited bandwidth. The usual
practice is to average down the spectra before downloading, but there are
clear single-channel outliers that will distort the averaged data. That can be
avoided if I flag the outliers, but I don’t know of a way to do that
automatedly. I could write a tool to do it, but that’d require my sketchy
Python library, which can only run here. And the data are at Hat Creek … etc.
I’ll just average them and worry about things later. It makes me sad to mess
up 24 channels’ worth of data when only 1 is the problem, but that’s life.
Hell, I’ve got 1024 channels; I can afford to waste a few.

Then a lot of lab. Still very enjoyable to work with the students. Some of us
chatted and agreed that it’d be useful to give them an overview not so much of
IDL but of general sound programming practices. I’ll try to put that together,
though it’ll probably take a while to do so. But I’ll be pretty happy if it
comes together in a way that I like. Well, that’s kind of tautological. But
yeah.
