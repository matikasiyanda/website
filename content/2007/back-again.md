Oh no, I’m blog-slacking! Gotta get my head back in the game.

Second half of my time at the ATA was productive — still haven’t looked at any
of the data taken for my proposal, but continued work on PAM optimization and
figured out a bunch more stuff that I’d like to do if I have the time. For the
PAM stuff, I was able to do in Java what I did with my sketchy Python back at
Berkeley, namely, extract Miriad gain information, which is totally the
hardest part of the exercise, so that’s good. Except that now I’m blocking on
the fact that it looks like my changes to PAM settings are overridden with the
defaults by the time observations start, which is a bit of a problem when you
want to find what the best settings are. But from what I’ve seen so far, I
have a hunch that some stray bit of software is resetting the defaults, and
with luck the offender can be tracked down and commented out pretty
painlessly.

Today was catching up on administrivia (reimbursement!) and the Star Formation
homework (due: last Thursday). A few roadblocks in the latter that feel a lot
more like errors in the set than mistakes that I’m making. I’ll ask some of
the people who’ve already handed the damn thing in — falls short of the
Platonic ideal of problem set practice, I guess, but I’ve been past that for a
while now.
