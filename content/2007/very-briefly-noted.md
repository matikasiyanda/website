Probably the most useful thing I did today was hang out and chitchat with some
of my students. Which I guess is maybe a bad way to put it … it’s true that I
didn’t do a lot work-wise today, but I think it really is important to do
mentory, advicey kinda stuff with the kids. It was fun and think they liked it
too.  Tomorrow, down to the CAT. Dreams of writing good code. Will they be
fulfilled? If history serves as an example, no. But maybe this time …
