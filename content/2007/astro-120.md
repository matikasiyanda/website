Today ended up being an AY120 day. I got some transit photometry data from
JohnJohn, and spent some time exploring the _pyfits_ module to see how to work
with FITS data in Python. The basic mechanics are obvious enough. I spent some
time reading JohnJohn’s reduction routines (written in IDL) trying to get a
sense of how the data should be dealt with at a higher level. I have a vague
sense of how aperture photometry and flatfielding should happen but it’s been
a little while since I’ve had to do them for real. If I had a full toolset, a
day or so of experimentation would be enough, I think, but I don’t know of a
way to plot 2D arrays (i.e., images) in Python. I’ll probably implement
something in OmegaPlot, but it will probably require a nontrivial amount of
new code, in which case I’m awfully tempted to sit down and rework the
internals. But doing that will probably take a week and it’s hard to justify
that kind of time sink. I should just bite the bullet and use PIL or something
as a stopgap.  After picking up new glasses and going to the jobs meeting, we
actually had the first 120 course meeting. Things look promising, but time-
consuming — I left at 9:30 PM, half an hour after the scheduled end of the
class, and pretty much all of the undergraduates were still there. It looks
like it’s going to be a lot of fun to work with them. I just hope there are
enough hours in the day to do that justice while still accomplishing something
resembling real research.
