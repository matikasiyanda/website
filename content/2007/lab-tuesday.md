As expected. Star formation, with a little bit of time spent rounding out the
solution set, then prepping for 120, then 120. Decided that I wasnâ€™t going to
give a real lecture for 120, so the preparation was mostly running through the
lab very sloppily to make sure that I had an idea of what it was like to
actually do. Nothing too exciting there.

Hopefully that means that the rest of this week will be free for work on ATA
data.
