Read about galaxies in broad terms for Galactic Dynamics.

Tried to answer some undergraduate questions about elementary statistics;
realized that I didnâ€™t really have that firm a grasp of things either and
tried to rectify that.

Went to a low-attendance RadioBeer.

Spent some more time on real photometry, following the _Handbook of CCD
Astronomy_. Apparently I was getting sky counts the wrong way. Took a stab at
the right way; not enough time to assess the situation. Will have to continue
things on Tuesday after the Sierra Conference.
