Took the end of last week off to travel. Today was spent prepping for the
lecture that I have to deliver tomorrow evening. Didn’t feel like I got a lot
done, but I did some preparation work and started jotting down ideas. Still
lacking an overall idea of how to structure things and, really, what themes to
emphasize — I’d basically like to talk about “how to program well” which, to
my mind, is as hard to pin down as “how to write well”. Fortunately, I’m under
no obligation to talk for 90 minutes or anything, so in the worst case I’ll
hit on the points I want to make and call it a day. But I think this is an
opportunity for me to share some genuine wisdom (if I do say so myself) so I’d
like to make the best of it.
