Star formation, then errands, then preparing for my optical lab lecture on
IDL, then giving said lecture, then the usual hanging out in the lab for hours
and hours. Lecture was OK; even though I tried to make it pretty down-to-
earth, I think it was still insufficiently concrete. Teaching is hard.  Maybe
Iâ€™ll get a chance to do research for the rest of the week?
