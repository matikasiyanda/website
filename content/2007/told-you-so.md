Today 120 was bitten in the ass by IDL. Hah. It was segfaulting when trying to
run certain graphical routines, apparently because of an abused XLib call that
was recently fixed in X.org. Things worked for some people though, and after
some clever detective work by Dan Logan a “fix” was devised that allowed
everyone to work, after losing only say an hour of time. Just saying, this
kind of thing wouldn’t have happened with Python. (Though the problem here is
more that IDL has an ancient and awful rendering model, not that it’s
proprietary.) Students seemed to be having fun making histograms of bias pixel
values; no one seemed to get to the point of plotting counts versus exposure
time for the flats.  Besides that, finally had time to extract antenna gains
from the second multi-FX8 dataset. The only real thing that took time was
double-checking that the data looked OK and that I could apply the routines I
wrote previously. Both of those seemed to be the case. Spent a little while
trying to think if there was any especially clever way to compare the old and
new gains, but didn’t come up with anything. Just looking at plots of the
gains over time, it looks like things mostly agree within the significant
jitter, and there probably isn’t much more to be said, quantitatively or
qualitatively, than that. I’ll poke at this a little bit more with Geoff, send
something to ata-user, and then hopefully get cracking on my broadband spectra
proposal.  Also, overview of clusters and associations in Star Formation
today. Fun class.
