Wrapping up an observing run from the basement of Campbell for 120. Looks like
we got some good data; took us a little while to get going (missed twilight
flats) but after then it was pretty much smooth sailing. Nice to see. There
were some weird large amplitude fluctuations over the course of the night, but
hopefully those weren’t symptomatic of a real technical or meteorological
issue.

I actually got a couple of things done, work-wise. Wrote up a
[draft checklist](http://astro.berkeley.edu/~pkwill/nickel_checklist.html) for
remote Nickel ops and read a bit about star formation. But more importantly, I
caught up on last week’s episode of The Office.

Oh, Friday was pretty much a non-day from catching up on sleep from the
previous night’s Lick run and watching baseball in the afternoon. And Thursday
was a non-day from the aforementioned Lick run. (Not that we got any data;
clouded out and got home at 1:00 AM or so.) Remote observing ain’t a bad gig,
I have to say.
