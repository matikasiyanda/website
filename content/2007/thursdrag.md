(My I am clever.) As usual for a Thursday, didn’t get a lot of done today,
between class and tea preparation. Worked on Highly Magical Flagging (TM) and
just set off an observing script, so hopefully I’ll have a nicer new dataset
to work with in the near future. I’m feeling a little bit hesitant about
putting in the time to get HMF working, but I’m pretty sure it could live up
to its name if I kept on pushing it in the direction I’m going. But I’m pretty
sure it will also be useful merely for looking at the data that I’ve got, so
even if I get cold feet about solving flagging once and for all, I think I’ve
still got a good piece of code.
