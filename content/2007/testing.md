So, the idea is to have a blog in which I write about my research work. Then
I’m actually forced to think about what I’m spending my time doing. And other
people can see what I’m doing. And when I get sidetracked wasting time for a
week, it’s obvious, and I am shamed into getting back to work. We’ll see how
it goes.  **Edit:** Oh yeah. No comments or trackbacks, because I don’t want
to have to deal with spam. If there are ever real actual people reading this,
remind me to change that.
