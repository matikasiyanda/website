Class and tea take up a lot of time on Thursdays. Spent the rest of my time
trying to fulfill my Galactic Dynamics responsibilities. If tomorrow’s
discussion isn’t really good, I’ll probably drop it; gotta prioritize, and I
don’t find myself that interested in the topic itself. I’ve been hoping to get
a lot out of it in the general how-to-read-a-paper end of things, but … again,
gotta prioritize.

Escargot and crab-stuffed sole for dinner, for free, thanks to colloquium.
