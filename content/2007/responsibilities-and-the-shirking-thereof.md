Not really, but a little. So I slept in today, after the observing last night,
and eventually got around to preparing the lab we’re going to hand out in 120
tomorrow. Then it was mentioned to me that there had been a bunch of students
dropping by my office looking for me, and, hey!, the lab is due tomorrow and
they probably want some help. So arrived at work at 5:00 PM, went up to the
lab, and got cracking on the anxiety-soothing and advice-dispensing.

I’m a bit disappointed that the error analysis portion of the current lab
seemed to give people a lot more trouble than I’d expected. I’d hoped that it
would be a bit tedious but clear, but apparently it was only the former. Not
too surprising, really, since I didn’t really sit down and think through every
word, but I thought I’d done an OK job of laying down what the expectations
were. Actually, I get the impression that the expectations were clear enough,
but that there were too many un-filled-in blanks about how to get there. But I
still feel kind of bad since I know from experience that nothing is fun than a
hard assignment where there’s just not enough help on how to do what you’re
supposed to be doing. Turns out, teaching is pretty hard! I atoned a bit by
writing a very long email to the class spelling things out in more detail —
hopefully that helped and didn’t just pile on the confusion.

I’m optimistic that next week’s lab will be a bit better. I think the things
we ask them to do are a bit simpler and are more spelled out. I’d like to get
really good at giving hard-but-comprehensible problems, but in the meantime
I’m happy to give easier ones instead. It’s not like the kids don’t have
enough work to do or anything.
