Observing last night, and technically a holiday today, so slept in. I think
this is the third or fourth consecutive Monday that I’ve done that.  Dealt
with getting the data from the previous night and a few other miscellaneous
tasks. Then worked on extending my broadband spectra results to the 4.5 – 5.5
GHz set of data I have. Took a while … until now, in particular … but the
results look pretty nice. There are still obvious issues that need to be
looked at, but the basic methodology seems to be working fairly well. Nice.
May post plots later once I’ve cleaned them up more thoroughly.  **Edit:** The
blog doesn’t seem to know about daylight savings. It’s really only 12:16 AM!
Thank god for that.
