Couldn’t really focus today. Or, I could, but by the end of yesterday I’d
reached a decent stopping point with broadband spectra stuff, and there wasn’t
an obvious high-priority task for me to work on. So I just spent some time
smoothing out a few rough edges of OmegaPlot instead. Very happy with how
that’s shaping up. Thursdays are usually unproductive anyway so I may finish a
few things there rather than trying to get back on track with research.  Or I
suppose I could start my Star Formation problem set… That would be prudent.
But who wants to be that way?
