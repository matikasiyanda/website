“This cocktail pays tribute to Laka, the Hawaiian goddess of song and
dance—patroness of hula dancers,” says Susan Eggett of Forbidden Island in San
Francisco’s East Bay. Eggett marries mezcal with a homespun cordial of
agricole rum and agave syrup. “At Forbidden Island, we garnish it with an
edible hibiscus flower,” she says. “A garnish fit for a Hawaiian deity.”

- 1 ½ oz. joven mezcal
- ¾ oz. fresh lime juice
- 1 oz. agricole rum-agave cordial
- 1 oz. ginger beer
- Glass: Collins
- Garnish: lime wheel and a hibiscus flower

Combine all ingredients except the ginger beer and shake well with ice. Strain
into a Collins glass filled with fresh ice cubes. Top with ginger beer and
garnish.

For the cordial: Heat 2 cups agave syrup and ½ cup water to a simmer, stirring
to combine. Remove from heat, let cool to room temperature, then stir in 2
ounces of agricole rum. Will keep refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
